I wanted to take a moment to reflect on the recent lab test. 
While I recognize there's room for improvement, the time constraints posed a challenge. 
I believe I can demonstrate my capabilities more effectively given different circumstances. 
I appreciate your understanding and looking forward to do my next lab test more positively in the future.
